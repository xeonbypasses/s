Prior steps:
	Create a new fresh discord server and make a webhook and put it in "config.json" this is to bypass the timeout feature that may occur if using a VPN

Step one:
	If you have not done so please download the script from GitHub

Step two:
	Once you have the script please create a seprate folder (can be named anything) and extract the files downloaded into the newly created folder

Step three:
	Open Google Chrome (and yes it must be Google Chrome)

Step four:
	Having Google opened, create a new tab with a already logged in Instagram account that wouldn't get a suspicious login message
	[If you save the login information of this account to Google you will have a better chance as your cookies won't clear]

Step five:
	Create another Google window, not just a tab but a whole new Google application

Step six:
	Log in to the Instagram account containing the suspicious login

Step seven: 
	Once you see the suspicious login attempt screen, run the script multiple times. Mind you, you will get an Error Message multiple times. This is normal.

Step eight:
	Enjoy your account you just got into!
